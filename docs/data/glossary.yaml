  - term: Source
    aliases:
      - Sources
      - Data Source
    short: A connection to an external system that Drasi monitors for data changes.
    definition: |
      Sources provide connectivity to systems that Drasi observes for changes. They process
      change logs from databases and other systems, translate data into a consistent property
      graph model, and push changes to subscribed Continuous Queries. Sources handle both
      real-time change streaming and initial data loading for query bootstrapping.

    aliases:
      - Continuous Queries
      - ContinuousQuery
    short: A query that runs continuously, maintaining an always-current result set as data changes.
    definition: |
      Continuous Queries are queries that run perpetually, maintaining an accurate result set
      that updates automatically as source data changes. Unlike traditional queries that return
      a point-in-time snapshot, Continuous Queries detect exactly which results have been added,
      updated, or deleted and distribute these changes to subscribed Reactions. They are written
      in Cypher or GQL and can span data from multiple Sources.

    short: A component that receives query result changes and takes action on them.
    definition: |
      Reactions process the stream of query result changes output by Continuous Queries and
      take action. Actions depend on the Reaction type and can include forwarding changes to
      Azure Event Grid, SignalR, or AWS EventBridge; executing stored procedures; updating
      databases; or triggering custom application logic. Multiple Reactions can subscribe to
      the same Continuous Query.

    definition: |
      Query Containers are the runtime environments that host Continuous Queries. They manage
      query execution, maintain query state, and handle the processing of source changes.
      A single Query Container can host multiple queries and can be scaled independently.
      Each container provides storage profiles for configuring how query indexes are stored.

  - term: Change Data Capture
    aliases:
      - CDC
    short: Technology that detects and captures changes made to database data.
    definition: |
      Change Data Capture (CDC) is a set of technologies and patterns for identifying and
      capturing changes made to data in a database. Drasi leverages CDC to monitor source
      systems for inserts, updates, and deletes. Drasi's source input schema is modeled on
      Debezium, an open-source CDC platform, enabling integration with many existing
      Debezium sources.

      - Query Result
      - Query Results
    short: The current output of a Continuous Query, updated automatically as data changes.
    definition: |
      The result set is the collection of records that currently satisfy a Continuous Query's
      criteria. Unlike traditional query results that are static snapshots, Drasi result sets
      are dynamic—they update automatically as source data changes. Changes to the result set
      are expressed as added, updated, and deleted records, which are distributed to Reactions.

    aliases:
      - Bootstrapping
      - Query Bootstrap
    short: The process of loading initial data when a Continuous Query starts.
    definition: |
      Bootstrap is the initialization process when a Continuous Query starts. During bootstrap,
      the query loads its initial state by querying the source systems for current data. This
      ensures the query result is accurate from the start, before processing the ongoing stream
      of changes. Storage profiles can affect bootstrap performance for queries with large
      initial result sets.

  - term: Instantaneous Query
    aliases:
      - Traditional Query
      - Point-in-time Query
    short: A conventional query that returns a static snapshot of data at a moment in time.
    definition: |
      An instantaneous query is a traditional database query that executes once and returns
      results representing the data at that specific point in time. After execution, the results
      are static and do not reflect subsequent changes. To detect changes, you must re-run the
      query and compare results. Drasi's Continuous Queries solve this limitation by maintaining
      a perpetually current result set.

  # =============================================================================
  # Query Language
  # =============================================================================
  - term: openCypher
    aliases:
      - openCypher Query Language
    short: A declarative graph query language used to write Drasi Continuous Queries.
    definition: |
      openCypher is a declarative graph query language originally developed for Neo4j. In Drasi,
      openCypher is one option for writing Continuous Queries. Its pattern-matching
      syntax makes it easy to describe complex relationships between data elements and specify
      which changes to detect. openCypher queries use MATCH, WHERE, and RETURN clauses to define
      patterns, filters, and output schemas.

    short: An ISO-standard graph query language supported by Drasi for Continuous Queries.
    definition: |
      GQL (Graph Query Language) is an ISO-standard query language for property graphs. Drasi
      supports GQL as an alternative to openCypher for writing Continuous Queries. GQL provides
      similar pattern-matching capabilities with standardized syntax. You can specify the
      query language in the Continuous Query configuration using the queryLanguage property.

      - Graph Node
    short: A data entity in the property graph model, representing a discrete object or concept.
    definition: |
      In Drasi's property graph model, a node represents a discrete entity such as a person,
      product, location, or event. Nodes have labels (types) and properties (key-value pairs).
      Sources transform data from various formats into nodes that Continuous Queries can
      process. In Cypher queries, nodes are represented in parentheses: (n:Label).

      - Edge
    short: A connection between two nodes in the property graph, representing how entities relate.
    definition: |
      Relationships (also called relations or edges) connect nodes in Drasi's property graph
      model. They have a type, direction, and can contain properties. Relationships enable
      Continuous Queries to traverse connections between data elements. In Cypher, relationships
      are written with square brackets: -[:RELATES_TO]->. Sources can define relationships
      explicitly or they can be created synthetically via joins.

    aliases:
      - Property Graph Model
    short: A data model where entities (nodes) and their connections (relationships) have properties.
    definition: |
      The property graph model is the data representation used internally by Drasi. In this
      model, data consists of nodes (entities) connected by relationships, where both can have
      properties (key-value pairs). Sources translate data from various formats (relational,
      document, etc.) into this unified model, enabling consistent querying across different
      source types.

    short: Configuration that controls how query indexes and state are persisted.
    definition: |
      Storage profiles define how Drasi stores Continuous Query element and solution indexes.
      The default Query Container provides 'memory' and 'redis' profiles. Memory-based storage
      is suitable for testing and queries without significant bootstrap requirements. Redis
      provides persistent storage for production workloads. The profile is specified in the
      Continuous Query's storageProfile property.

  - term: Middleware
    aliases:
      - Query Middleware
    short: Custom processing logic applied to source changes before query evaluation.
    definition: |
      Middleware enables custom logic to be executed on incoming source changes before they
      are processed by a Continuous Query. Middleware configurations are defined in the query
      spec and can be chained in a pipeline for each source subscription. This allows
      transformation, filtering, or enrichment of change data.

    short: A mapping that connects data from multiple Sources based on matching properties.
    definition: |
      Joins in Drasi create mappings between nodes from different Sources based on property
      values. This enables Continuous Queries to traverse relationships across source
      boundaries as if querying a unified graph. Joins are defined in the query's
      spec.sources.joins section by specifying label and property pairs that should match.

      - Change Processing
      - DCP
    short: The continuous detection and processing of meaningful data changes across systems.
    definition: |
      Data Change Processing is the core capability that Drasi provides. It involves
      continuously monitoring data sources for changes, evaluating those changes against
      Continuous Queries to identify meaningful patterns, and distributing detected
      changes to downstream systems through Reactions. Unlike traditional batch processing,
      Data Change Processing operates in real-time as changes occur.

    definition: |
      A Source Change Event is the internal representation of a data change detected
      by a Source. It contains the type of change (insert, update, or delete), the
      affected data in property graph format, and metadata such as timestamps. Sources
      emit these events when underlying data changes, which are then processed by
      subscribed Continuous Queries.

    Building a GitHub Bot with Drasi
---

## Scenario

In this tutorial, we will build a GitHub Bot. The bot will monitor issues in a GitHub repository, with the following behavior:
- When a new issue is opened, it will automatically comment with a thank you message.
- When an issue is closed, it will automatically comment.
- When an open issue has not had a comment for x amount of time, it will add a `stale` label to it.
- When an open issue that is stale, is commented on, the `stale` label should be removed.
- When an issue is closed, it is not considered stale.

### Tutorial Modes

You can follow along the steps below in a Github codespace, a VSCode Dev Container or your own Kubernetes environment.

{{< tabpane >}}

{{% tab header="Github Codespaces" text=true %}}

The easiest way to follow along with this tutorial is to launch a Github
  Codespace using the link below. This will allow you to run the example
  application within your browser without setting up anything on your own
  machines.

[![Open in Github Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/drasi-project/learning?devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fgithub-bot%2Fdevcontainer.json&machine=standardLinux32gb)

This will open a page with some configuration options. Make sure that the
  **Branch** selected is **main** and set the **Dev Container configuration** to **GitHub bot with Drasi**.

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab header="VS Code Container" text=true %}}

To follow along with a Dev Container, you will need to install:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Visual Studio Code [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) 
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

Next, [clone the learning repo from Github](https://github.com/drasi-project/learning),
  and open the repo in VS Code. Make sure that Docker daemon
  (or Docker Desktop) is running.

Once the solution is open in VS Code, follow these steps:
- Press Cmd + Shift + P (on MacOS) or Ctrl + Shift + P (Windows or Linux) to
    launch the command palette.
- Select `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`.
- Select the `GitHub bot with Drasi` option to launch this tutorial.

{{% tab header="Local Setup" text=true %}}

You need to have Docker Desktop on your local machine, or your own Kubernetes cluster.

For guidance on how to install Drasi for Docker:
  - [Install on Docker](../../how-to-guides/installation/install-on-docker)

To setup a local Kubernetes cluster and install Drasi on it, K3s and Kind are both good options:
  - [Install on k3s](../../how-to-guides/installation/install-on-k3s)
  - [Install on Kind](../../how-to-guides/installation/install-on-kind)

Next, [clone the learning repo from Github](https://github.com/drasi-project/learning) and open a terminal in the `/tutorial/github-bot` directory.

## Prerequisites

To capture the change feed from GitHub, we will use the [GitHub Webhooks](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks) functionality. These webhooks require a public Http endpoint to receive the changes. To solve this, we will setup a simple Azure Function that will forward the body of the incoming Http message to an EventHub message, and then we will use the EventHub source to connect it to Drasi.

For this tutorial, you will need an Azure account. The setup of the Function and EventHub has been packaged into an ARM template, that can be deployed using the button below:


<a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdrasi-project%2Flearning%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Ftutorial%2Fgithub-bot%2Fazure-resources.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
  <img src="https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton" alt="Deploy to Azure">
</a>

After clicking this button, it should take you to the Azure portal to confirm the parameters for the deployment:

{{< figure src="arm-inputs.png" >}}

Click `Review + create` and wait a few minutes while the resources are deployed.

Once the deployment is complete, click on the `Outputs` tab which will provide you with the connection string for the EventHub and the URL of the Function.

{{< figure src="arm-outputs.png" >}}

Copy these values to a notepad, as we will use the Function URL to setup the webhook in the GitHub portal and the EventHub connection string will be used to configure the Drasi source.

## Configure the webhook

Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a new private repository for the purpose of this tutorial.

Once you have created the repository, go to the `Settings` > `Webhooks` page, and create a new webhook.

Paste the Function URL into the `Payload URL` field.

Set the `Content type` to `application/json`.

For `Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?`, pick the `Send me everything` option.

{{< figure src="webhook.png" >}}

Click `Add webhook`, this will setup a webhook that will send events occurring in GitHub to the Http endpoint provided.

## Deploy the source

Use the EventHub connection string from the outputs to configure a secret:

```bash
drasi secret set event-hub connection-string "<connection string>"
```

We will use the following source manifest to create a Drasi source that reads the EventHub we just created.

```yaml
kind: Source
apiVersion: v1
name: github
spec:
  kind: EventHub
  properties:
    connectionString: 
      kind: Secret
      name: event-hub
      key: connection-string
    eventHubs:
      - github
```

This can be deployed using the following command:

```bash
drasi apply -f source.yaml
drasi wait -f source.yaml
```

## Deploy the open issues query

Next, we will create a continuous query that will monitor open issues. The basic structure of the message from GitHub will look as follows:


```json
{
  "action": "opened",
  "issue": {
    "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/my-org/test-repo",
    "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/my-org/test-repo",
    "id": 100,
    "number": 55,
    "title": "Issue title",
    "user": {
      "login": "xxxxxx",
      "id": 200,
      "type": "User"
    },
    "labels": [ ],
    "state": "open",
    "assignees": [ ],
    "body": "Issue body"
  },
  "repository": {
    "id": 300,
    "name": "test-repo",
    "full_name": "my-org/test-repo",
    "default_branch": "main"
  }
}
```

We will use the `map` middleware to map the incoming JSON document onto a graph node. The following query will emit added results when an issue is opened and deleted results when the issue is closed. All changes from the EventHub source will be reflected as an `insert`, with the label of the EventHub itself, in this case, it is `github`. 

The middleware defined in this query:

* Extracts the `issue` object from the JSON document using: `selector: $.issue`
* When an issue is opened:
  * Checks condition: `$[?(@.event == 'issues' && @.action == 'opened')]`
  * Applies an insert/update operation to create a graph node: `op: Update`
  * Labels the node as `Issue`: `label: Issue`
  * Uses the issue's ID as the node ID: (`id: $['$selected'].id`)
* When an issue is closed:
  * Checks condition: `$[?(@.event == 'issues' && @.action == 'closed')]`
  * Applies a delete operation to remove the graph node: `op: Delete`

[Click here to learn more about the Map middleware](../../concepts/middleware/#map)

After that, we have a Cypher query that just returns all the `Issue` nodes in the graph. 


```yaml
kind: ContinuousQuery
apiVersion: v1
name: open-issues
spec:
  mode: query
  sources:
    subscriptions:
      - id: github
        nodes:
          - sourceLabel: github
        pipeline:
          - extract
    middleware:
      - name: extract
        kind: map
        github:
          insert:
            - selector: $.issue
              condition: $[?(@.event == 'issues' && @.action == 'opened')]
              op: Update
              label: Issue
              id: $['$selected'].id
              properties:
                id: $['$selected'].id
                title: $['$selected'].title
                number: $['$selected'].number
                creator: $['$selected'].user.login
                repo: $.repository.full_name
            - selector: $.issue
              condition: $[?(@.event == 'issues' && @.action == 'closed')]
              op: Delete
              label: Issue
              id: $['$selected'].id
              
  query: |
    MATCH 
      (i:Issue)
    RETURN 
      i.id AS id, 
      i.title AS title, 
      i.repo AS repo, 
      i.number AS issue_number, 
      i.creator AS creator
```

This query already exists in the tutorial folder, so you can deploy it with the following command:


```bash
drasi apply -f query-open-issues.yaml
```

## Create a GitHub Access Token

In order to invoke actions on GitHub, we will need to be authenticated. To do this we will use a personal access token. At this point, if you wish to create a dedicated GitHub account for your bot, you can do so.

Go to the `Settings` > `Developer Settings` > `Personal access tokens` > `Fine-grained tokens` page in your GitHub profile.

Click `Generate new token`

For repository access, ensure that it has explicit access to the repository that you created earlier.

For permissions, enable read and write access to `Issues`:

{{< figure src="permissions.png" >}}

Click `Generate token`, and copy the PAT into the following command to create a secret:

```bash
drasi secret set github token "<GitHub PAT>"
```


## Deploy the open issues reaction

We will use the `Http` reaction to invoke GitHub APIs when the query emits diffs to the result set. This reaction enables you to define the URL and body of the Http request using Handlebars templates, where the fields of the result can be accessed via the `before` and `after` objects.

In this case, when an issue is created, we will post a thank you comment. When it is closed, we will post a comment to say so.

For details on the GitHub API, please see the [GitHub API documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)

```yaml
kind: Reaction
apiVersion: v1
name: open-reaction
spec:
  kind: Http
  properties:
    baseUrl: "https://api.github.com"
    token: 
      kind: Secret
      name: github
      key: token
  queries:
    open-issues: >
      added:
        url: "/repos/{{after.repo}}/issues/{{after.issue_number}}/comments"
        method: "POST"
        body: > 
          {
            "body": "Hello! @{{after.creator}}, thank you for your contribution!!"
          }
      deleted:
        url: "/repos/{{before.repo}}/issues/{{before.issue_number}}/comments"
        method: "POST"
        body: > 
          {
            "body": "This issue has now been closed."
          }
```

This reaction already exists in the tutorial folder, so you can deploy it with the following command:

```bash
drasi apply -f reaction-open-issues.yaml
```


## Deploy the stale issues query

Next, we will create a continuous query that will monitor issues that have become stale. This query will track when issues haven't received comments for a specified period of time.

The middleware defined in this query will extract both `issue` and `comment` objects from the JSON documents. For issue events, it will update the graph node with basic issue information including the creation time (`createdAt`). For comment events, it will update the same issue node with the timestamp of the last comment (`lastCommentAt`).

Here's what the Cypher query is doing:

- `MATCH (i:Issue)` - Finds all nodes labeled as "Issue" in the graph.
- `WHERE i.state = 'open'` - Filters for issues that are currently open.
- `AND drasi.trueNowOrLater(...)` - Evaluates if an issue has become stale.
  - `coalesce(i.lastCommentAt, i.createdAt)` - Gets the timestamp of either the last comment or the issue creation (if no comments)
  - `datetime(...) + duration({ seconds: 15 })` - Calculates the time when the issue becomes stale (15 seconds after last activity)
  - `<= datetime.realtime()` - Checks if that stale time has been reached. `datetime.realtime()` returns the current timestamp.
  - The second parameter `datetime.transaction() + duration({ seconds: 15 })` tells the system when to check again if the condition isn't true yet. `datetime.transaction()` returns the timestamp of the change coming from the source.
  - The `drasi.trueNowOrLater` function ensures that the query result is updated at the moment when an issue becomes stale, even if no new events occur. [Click here to learn more about this function](../../reference/query-language/#drasi-future-functions)


```yaml
kind: ContinuousQuery
apiVersion: v1
name: stale-issues
spec:
  mode: query
  sources:
    subscriptions:
      - id: github
        nodes:
          - sourceLabel: github
        pipeline:
          - extract
    middleware:
      - name: extract
        kind: map
        github:
          insert:
            - selector: $.issue
              op: Update
              label: Issue
              id: $['$selected'].id
              properties:
                id: $['$selected'].id
                title: $['$selected'].title
                state: $['$selected'].state
                number: $['$selected'].number
                repo: $.repository.full_name
                createdAt: $['$selected'].created_at
            - selector: $.comment
              op: Update
              label: Issue
              id: $.issue.id
              properties:
                lastCommentAt: $['$selected'].created_at
              
  query: |
    MATCH 
      (i:Issue)
    WHERE i.state = 'open'
    AND drasi.trueNowOrLater(
          (datetime(coalesce(i.lastCommentAt, i.createdAt)) + duration({ seconds: 15 })) <= datetime.realtime(), 
          datetime.transaction() + duration({ seconds: 15 })
        )
    RETURN 
      i.id AS id,       
      i.title AS title,
      i.repo AS repo,
      i.number AS issue_number
```

This query already exists in the tutorial folder, so you can deploy it with the following command:

```bash
drasi apply -f query-stale-issues.yaml
```

## Deploy the stale issues reaction

We will use the `Http` reaction to invoke GitHub APIs when the stale issues query emits diffs to the result set. This reaction will manage the `stale` label on GitHub issues based on their activity status.

When an issue becomes stale (appears in the query results), the reaction will add a `stale` label to the issue. When an issue is no longer stale (gets removed from the query results, typically due to new activity), the reaction will remove the `stale` label.

```yaml
kind: Reaction
apiVersion: v1
name: stale-reaction
spec:
  kind: Http
  properties:
    baseUrl: "https://api.github.com"
    token: 
      kind: Secret
      name: github
      key: token
  queries:
    stale-issues: >
      added:
        url: "/repos/{{after.repo}}/issues/{{after.issue_number}}/labels"
        method: "POST"
        body: > 
          {
            "labels": ["stale"]
          }
      deleted:
        url: "/repos/{{before.repo}}/issues/{{before.issue_number}}/labels/stale"
        method: "DELETE"
```

This reaction already exists in the tutorial folder, so you can deploy it with the following command:

```bash
drasi apply -f reaction-stale-issues.yaml
```

## Try it out

Go to your GitHub repo and create a new issue. You should see a thank message generated, and if you wait 15 seconds without adding a new comment, it will be labeled as `stale`.


{{< figure src="issue-1.png" width="600px" >}}

Now, add a comment to the issue and the `stale` label should be removed.

{{< figure src="issue-2.png" width="600px" >}}

Now, close the issue and a comment will be automatically added stating that it has been closed. If it had a `stale` label, it will also be removed when the issue is closed because the `WHERE i.state = 'open'` clause in the query filters it out of the result set for the stale issues query.

    Learn Drasi through hands-on, step-by-step tutorials
---

<div class="section-header section-header--tutorials">
  <p class="section-intro">Tutorials guide you through learning Drasi by doing. Each tutorial is designed to be completed in a single session and teaches practical skills you can apply immediately.</p>
</div>

## How Tutorials Work

Our tutorials follow a **learning-oriented** approach:

- **Hands-on**: You'll write real code and see real results
- **Step-by-step**: Each tutorial builds progressively
- **Safe to fail**: Designed environments where experimentation is encouraged
- **Concrete outcomes**: You'll have something working by the end

- **[Absence of Change](/tutorials/absence-of-change/)** - Detect when expected changes don't happen

## Tutorial Format

Each tutorial includes:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Objective** | What you'll learn and build |
| **Prerequisites** | What you need before starting |
| **Time Estimate** | How long it typically takes |
| **Steps** | Detailed, numbered instructions |
| **Verification** | How to confirm success |
| **Next Steps** | Where to go from here |

## Tips for Success

1. **Follow the sequence** - Tutorials build on each other
2. **Type the code** - Don't just copy/paste; typing helps you learn
3. **Experiment** - After completing a tutorial, try variations
4. **Ask questions** - Use [Discord](https://aka.ms/drasidiscord) if you get stuck

## After Tutorials

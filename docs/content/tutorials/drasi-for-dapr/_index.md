    Learn how Drasi can supercharge your Dapr applications with real-time data change processing across distributed microservices
---


This scenario was also demonstrated as part of Dapr Community Call #123. Watch below:
{{< youtube S-ImhYfLplM >}}

## Scenario

Imagine an e-commerce platform built with Dapr microservices, where each service manages its own state store independently:

* **Products Service**: Manages product inventory and stock levels
* **Customers Service**: Tracks customer information and tier levels (Gold, Silver, Bronze)
* **Orders Service**: Processes customer orders and delivery status
* **Reviews Service**: Handles product reviews and ratings

{{< figure src="02-ecommerce-scenario.png"
  alt="Four Dapr services, each with its own PostgreSQL state store" width="50%" >}}

Each service uses Dapr's state management building block with PostgreSQL as the backing store, following microservices best practices of data isolation.

### The Challenges

While Dapr provides excellent building blocks for microservices, certain cross-service scenarios remain challenging:

#### 1. Derived Data Challenge
The marketing team wants a product catalog that combines:
- Product details from the Products Service
- Average ratings and review counts from the Reviews Service
- Real-time stock levels

{{< figure src="06-derived-data-challenge.png"
  alt="The derived data challenge without Drasi" width="60%" >}}

Without Drasi, this would require:
- API orchestration across multiple services
- Caching layers to avoid constant polling
- Complex synchronization logic when data changes

#### 2. Real-Time Monitoring Challenge
The operations team needs dashboards showing:
- Gold customers with delayed orders (say >2 days)
- Orders at risk due to insufficient stock
- Real-time updates as conditions change

{{< figure src="07-dashboard-challenge.png"
  alt="The real-time monitoring challenge without Drasi" width="60%" >}}

Traditional approaches would involve:
- Periodic polling of multiple services
- Client-side data correlation
- Significant network overhead

#### 3. Intelligent Business Events Challenge
The inventory team needs differentiated alerts:
- **Low stock warning** when inventory drops below 20 units
- **Critical stock alert** when inventory drops below 5 units
- Different teams notified based on severity

{{< figure src="08-eventing-challenge.png"
  alt="The intelligent business events challenge without Drasi" width="60%" >}}

This typically requires:
- Custom event processing logic
- State management for threshold tracking
- Complex pub/sub routing rules

### Traditional Approaches

For the derived data scenario, you could decide to use an API Gateway to aggregate data from multiple services. You could also introduce a caching layer to avoid repeatedly querying the underlying services, but the complexity and failure rates remain high.

For all the scenarios, you could use event sourcing with CQRS, where services publish domain events to an event store and build read models on top of that. Then query services can serve aggregated data and event processors handle business logic. This comes with a complete audit trail, but comes with significant architectural changes and require modifications to existing services.

You could also use Change Data Capture with stream processing, but you will need complex infrastructure setup (Kafka, Flink, etc.) and operational overhead. You must also deal with schema evolution changes.

### Enter Drasi

What if you could solve these challenges without writing backend code or managing complex infrastructure?

Drasi provides a data change processing platform that:
- **Monitors your Dapr state stores** via PostgreSQL logical replication
- **Processes complex queries** across multiple databases in real-time
- **Triggers reactions** only when meaningful conditions are met
- **Requires zero changes** to your existing Dapr services

#### Why Drasi for Dapr Users?

**Built on Dapr**: Drasi itself runs on Dapr and uses Dapr building blocks internally (Actors, State Stores, Pub/Sub). Installing Drasi automatically installs Dapr if not present.

**Non-Invasive Integration**: Connects directly to your PostgreSQL state stores without modifying services or adding SDKs.

**Declarative Queries**: Write Cypher queries to detect complex patterns across services - no imperative code needed.

**Native Dapr Reactions**: Purpose-built reactions for Dapr ecosystems:
- Sync Dapr State Store for materialized views
- Post Dapr Pub/Sub for event generation
- SignalR for real-time updates

Here's how our architecture looks with Drasi:

{{< figure src="01-architecture-overview.png"
  alt="Architecture showing four Dapr services with PostgreSQL state stores, Drasi monitoring via logical replication, and three Drasi-powered services" width="100%" >}}

## Dapr + Drasi Tutorial

This tutorial will guide you through setting up a complete e-commerce scenario demonstrating Drasi's capabilities with Dapr applications.

### What You'll Build

1. **Product Catalog Service**: A materialized view combining products and review statistics
2. **Operations Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of at-risk orders and Gold customer delays
3. **Notifications Service**: Intelligent inventory alerts with business logic

### Tutorial Modes

You can follow along in three different environments:

{{< tabpane >}}

{{% tab header="GitHub Codespaces" text=true %}}

The easiest way to follow this tutorial is using GitHub Codespaces. Everything will be pre-configured in your browser.

[![Open in Github Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=778887889&skip_quickstart=true&machine=standardLinux32gb&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdapr%2Fdevcontainer.json)

This will open a configuration page like shown below. Ensure the following:
- Branch: `main`
- Dev container configuration: **`Drasi For Dapr`**
- Machine type: Prefer 8-core or higher

{{< figure src="Codespaces_01_Config.png"
  alt="Screenshot showing Codespaces configuration with Drasi For Dapr selected" width="80%" >}}

The Codespace will take about 5 minutes to initialize. You'll see setup logs in the terminal showing:
- K3d cluster creation
- Drasi platform installation (includes Dapr)
- PostgreSQL and Redis deployment
- All microservices deployment
- Load initial data

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab header="VSCode DevContainer" text=true %}}

To use a Dev Container locally, you'll need:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
- At least 16GB available RAM

Steps:
1. [Clone the learning repository](https://github.com/drasi-project/learning)
2. Open the repository in VS Code
3. When prompted, click "Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container"
4. Select `Drasi for Dapr` from the list
5. Wait for initialization (~5 minutes)

The Dev Container will automatically:
- Create a k3d cluster
- Install Drasi (includes Dapr)
- Deploy all services
- Load initial data

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab header="Local Setup" text=true %}}

For local Kubernetes setup, you'll need:
- Docker
- kubectl
- k3d (or another Kubernetes distribution)
- [Drasi CLI](https://drasi.io/reference/command-line-interface/#get-the-drasi-cli)

Navigate to the tutorial directory and run the setup script:

```bash
cd tutorial/dapr

# For Linux/Mac
./scripts/setup-tutorial.sh

# For Windows PowerShell
./scripts/setup-tutorial.ps1
```

The script will:
1. Create a k3d cluster with port mapping
2. Install Drasi platform (includes Dapr)
3. Deploy PostgreSQL databases for each service
4. Deploy Redis for notifications
5. Deploy all Dapr services
6. Load initial data

{{% /tab %}}

{{% /tabpane %}}

### Verify the Setup

Once setup is complete, verify all services are running:

```bash
kubectl get svc
```

You should see:
- 4 core services (products, customers, orders, reviews)
- 3 Drasi-powered services (catalogue, dashboard, notifications)
- PostgreSQL instances for each service
- Redis for notifications

{{< tabpane >}}

{{% tab header="GitHub Codespaces" text=true %}}

Access the services via the forwarded ports. Check the **PORTS** tab in VS Code:

{{< figure src="Codespaces_02_Ports.png"
  alt="Screenshot showing forwarded ports in Codespaces" width="100%" >}}

Your URLs will be:

{{% /tabpane %}}

### Deploy Drasi Components

Now let's deploy the Drasi sources, queries, and reactions that will power our enhanced services:

{{< tabpane >}}

{{% tab header="VSCode Extension" text=true %}}

If you're following the tutorial in a Codespace or DevContainer, you can use the VSCode Extension available for Drasi as shown here. The `Drasi Explorer` shows the state of your Drasi clusters, and the `Workspace` shows the Drasi YAML files detected in the project.

{{< figure src="Extension-01-Overview.png"
  alt="Drasi extension shown here in a VSCode DevContainer" width="40%" >}}

Apply the `products-source` yaml like from the workspace shown below:

{{< figure src="Extension-02-Add-Products-Source.png"
  alt="Find the Products source yaml in Drasi Extension's workspace and click Apply" width="40%" >}}

Similarly apply the other three sources - `reviews-source`, `orders-source`, `customers-source`. You should see the sources in Red in the Drasi Explorer as shown here:

{{< figure src="Extension-03-All-Sources-Added.png"
  alt="All sources are shown added in the Drasi Explorer, still in red" width="40%" >}}

Wait for the sources to become available. They should become available in a couple minutes. If not, try the refresh button on the Drasi Explorer. Once available, all sources will show up as green:

{{< figure src="Extension-04-All-Sources-Available.png"
  alt="Sources are now available, showing up as green in Drasi explorer" width="40%" >}}

Now, apply all the queries from the workspace one by one:

{{< figure src="Extension-05-Add-Catalogue-Query.png"
  alt="Apply Products Catalogue Query from Drasi Extension's Workspace" width="40%" >}}

Wait for them to bootstrap and once they're running, they will show up as green:

{{< figure src="Extension-06-All-Queries-Available.png"
  alt="All queries are now available and running as indicated by green color in the extension." width="40%" >}}

Finally, apply all the reactions from the workspace one by one:

{{< figure src="Extension-07-Add-SignalR-Reaction.png"
  alt="Apply SignalR reaction from Drasi Extension's Workspace" width="40%" >}}

Wait for them to bootstrap and once they're running, they will show up as green:

{{< figure src="Extension-08-All-Reactions-Available.png"
  alt="All reactions are now available and running as indicated by green color in the extension." width="40%" >}}

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab header="Drasi CLI" text=true %}}

Deploy Drasi Sources and wait for them to be live:
```bash
drasi apply -f drasi/sources/*
drasi wait -f drasi/sources/*
```
<br/>
Verify Drasi sources are ready:

```bash
drasi list sources
```
<br/>
The source must report `Available` as `true`. Expected output:

```plaintext
         ID        | AVAILABLE | MESSAGES  
-------------------+-----------+-----------
  products-source  | true      |           
  reviews-source   | true      |           
  orders-source    | true      |           
  customers-source | true      |    
```

<br/>
Next, deploy Continuous Queries and wait for them to be live:

```bash
drasi apply -f drasi/queries/*
drasi wait -f drasi/queries/*
```
<br/>
Verify Drasi queries are ready:

```bash
drasi list query
```
<br/>
The queries must report `Status` as `Running`. Expected output:

```plaintext
              ID             | CONTAINER | ERRORMESSAGE |              HOSTNAME              | STATUS   
-----------------------------+-----------+--------------+------------------------------------+----------
  product-catalogue-query    | default   |              | default-query-host-57c7796d5-fnttx | Running  
  low-stock-event-query      | default   |              | default-query-host-57c7796d5-fnttx | Running  
  delayed-gold-orders-query  | default   |              | default-query-host-57c7796d5-fnttx | Running  
  critical-stock-event-query | default   |              | default-query-host-57c7796d5-fnttx | Running  
  at-risk-orders-query       | default   |              | default-query-host-57c7796d5-fnttx | Running
```

<br/>
Finally, deploy Reactions and wait for them to be live:

```bash
drasi apply -f drasi/reactions/*
drasi wait -f drasi/reactions/*
```
<br/>
Verify Drasi queries are ready:

```bash
drasi list reaction
```
<br/>
The reactions must report `Available` as `true`. Expected output:

```plaintext
               ID               | AVAILABLE | MESSAGES  
--------------------------------+-----------+-----------
  stock-notifications-publisher | true      |           
  maintain-product-catalogue    | true      |           
  signalr                       | true      |  
```

### Demo 1: Materialized State Store

The Product Catalog demonstrates how Drasi can maintain a materialized view combining data from multiple services.

#### Understanding the Query

Let's examine the `product-catalogue` query that powers this feature:

```cypher
MATCH
   (r:reviews)-[:REVIEW_TO_PRODUCT]->(p:products)
WITH
   p, avg(r.rating) as avgRating, count(r) as reviewCount
RETURN
   p.productId AS product_id,
   p.productName AS product_name,
   p.productDescription AS product_description,
   avgRating AS avg_rating,
   reviewCount AS review_count
```

This query:
- Matches all products
- Joins with reviews for each product
- Calculates review statistics
- Returns a complete catalog entry

#### The Sync Dapr State Store Reaction

The reaction configuration syncs query results to a new Dapr state store:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: sync-dapr-statestore
data:
  query: product-catalogue
  daprStateStoreName: catalogue-statestore-drasi
  daprAppId: drasi-reaction
```

#### See It In Action

{{< tabpane >}}

{{% tab header="GitHub Codespaces" text=true %}}

1. Open the Catalog UI:
   ```
   https://<codespace-name>-80.app.github.dev/catalogue-service
   ```

2. Note the products display with review statistics

3. In a new terminal, run the demo script:
   ```bash
   cd demo
   ./demo-catalogue-service.sh
   ```

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab header="VSCode DevContainer" text=true %}}

1. Open the Catalog UI:
   ```
   http://localhost:8123/catalogue-service
   ```

2. Note the products display with review statistics

3. In a new terminal, run the demo script:
   ```bash
   cd demo
   ./demo-catalogue-service.sh
   ```

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab header="Local Setup" text=true %}}

1. Open the Catalog UI:
   ```
   http://localhost:8123/catalogue-service
   ```

2. Note the products display with review statistics

3. In a new terminal, run the demo script:
   ```bash
   cd demo
   ./demo-catalogue-service.sh
   ```

{{% /tab %}}

{{% /tabpane %}}

The demo will:
1. Show current catalog state
2. Add new reviews to products
3. Demonstrate real-time catalog updates
4. Modify product prices
5. Show immediate reflection in the UI

{{< figure src="03-screenshot-catalog-service.png"
  alt="Product catalog showing materialized view with products and review statistics" width="80%" >}}

Key observations:
- **No API calls** between services
- **No polling** for updates
- **Immediate consistency** when data changes
- **Zero code** for aggregation logic

### Demo 2: Real-Time Dashboard

The dashboard demonstrates complex monitoring queries across multiple services.

#### Query 1: At-Risk Orders

```cypher
MATCH
   (o:orders)-[:ITEM_OF_ORDER]->(oi:orderItem),
   (oi)-[:ORDER_ITEM_TO_PRODUCT]->(p:products)
WHERE
   o.orderStatus IN ['PENDING', 'PAID'] AND
   p.stockOnHand < oi.quantity
RETURN
   o.orderId AS orderId,
   o.customerId AS customerId,
   o.orderStatus AS orderStatus,
   oi.quantity AS quantity,
   p.productId AS productId,
   p.productName AS productName,
   p.stockOnHand AS stockOnHand
```

This query identifies orders that are in `PENDING` or `PAID` state, but cannot be fulfilled due to stock shortages.

#### Query 2: Delayed Gold Orders

```cypher
MATCH
   (o:orders)-[:ORDER_TO_CUSTOMER]->(c:customers)
WHERE
   c.loyaltyTier = 'GOLD'
WITH
   o, c, drasi.changeDateTime(o) as waitingSince
WHERE
   drasi.trueFor(o.orderStatus = 'PROCESSING', duration ({ seconds: 10 }))
RETURN
   o.orderId AS orderId,
   o.orderStatus AS orderStatus,
   c.customerId AS customerId,
   c.customerName AS customerName,
   c.customerEmail AS customerEmail,
   waitingSince
```

This detects orders from Gold customers that are stuck in `PROCESSING` state for more than 10 seconds. Of course, in the real world we can change this to be days or any arbitrary time interval.

But this query highlights the unique ability of Drasi to monitor not just for changes, but also for absence of changes. Here we are using `trueFor` - which is one of Drasi's [many future functions](/reference/query-language/drasi-custom-functions/#drasi-future-functions).

#### SignalR Reaction

The SignalR reaction streams query results in real-time:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Reaction
name: signalr
spec:
  kind: SignalR
  queries:
    at-risk-orders-query:
    delayed-gold-orders-query:
```

When you apply this simple YAML file to Drasi, it will deploy a new reaction which is a full fledged web-socket server that is based on SignalR (and therefore gets the websocket fallback mechanisms from SignalR like SSE, etc.).

Drasi also frontend components for [React](/tutorials/connecting-frontends/react) and [Vue](/tutorials/connecting-frontends/vue) published to NPM, which makes it really easy to build reactive front-end dashboards that display the live result set of Drasi's continuous queries.

#### See It In Action

We've written an interactive demo script for you to see the dashboard live in action.

{{< tabpane >}}

{{% tab header="GitHub Codespaces" text=true %}}

1. Open the Dashboard:
   ```
   https://<codespace-name>-80.app.github.dev/dashboard
   ```

2. Run the demo script:
   ```bash
   cd demo
   ./demo-dashboard-service.sh
   ```

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab header="VSCode DevContainer" text=true %}}

1. Open the Dashboard:
   ```
   http://localhost:8123/dashboard
   ```

2. Run the demo script:
   ```bash
   cd demo
   ./demo-dashboard-service.sh
   ```

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab header="Local Setup" text=true %}}

1. Open the Dashboard:
   ```
   http://localhost:8123/dashboard
   ```

2. Run the demo script:
   ```bash
   cd demo
   ./demo-dashboard-service.sh
   ```

{{% /tab %}}

{{% /tabpane %}}

The demo will:
1. Create orders for Gold customers
2. Show real-time dashboard updates
3. Simulate order delays
4. Reduce product stock
5. Display at-risk orders immediately

{{< figure src="04-screenshot-dashboard.png"
  alt="Operations dashboard showing Gold customer delays and at-risk orders" width="100%" >}}

Watch for:
- **WebSocket connections** established automatically
- **Instant updates** when conditions are met
- **Automatic removal** when conditions no longer apply
- **Cross-service correlations** without API calls

### Demo 3: Intelligent Notifications

The notifications service demonstrates event transformation and intelligent routing. Let's consider the two queries that give us actionable business events instead of raw change-events.

#### Low Stock Event Query
Following query maintains the list of products for which the stock is below threshold but is still not zero:
```cypher
MATCH
   (p:products)
WHERE
   p.stockOnHand <= p.lowStockThreshold AND p.stockOnHand > 0
RETURN
   p.productId AS productId,
   p.productName AS productName,
   p.stockOnHand AS stockOnHand,
   p.lowStockThreshold AS lowStockThreshold
```

#### Critical Stock Event Query
Following query maintains the list of products for which the stock is completely exhausted:
```cypher
MATCH
   (p:products)
WHERE
   p.stockOnHand = 0
RETURN
   p.productId AS productId,
   p.productName AS productName,
   p.productDescription AS productDescription
```

#### Post Dapr Pub/Sub Reaction

With the following YAML file, we can tell Drasi on how to route the business events to a dapr pub-sub. Here we can control what topic to route events to, their format and other settings. More details on how to setup a Post-Dapr-PubSub Reaction [in Drasi are here](/how-to-guides/configure-reactions/configure-post-pubsub-reaction).

```yaml
kind: Reaction
apiVersion: v1
name: stock-notifications-publisher
spec:
  kind: PostDaprPubSub
  queries:
    # Publish low stock events to the "low-stock-events" topic
    low-stock-event-query: >
      {
        "pubsubName": "notifications-pubsub",
        "topicName": "low-stock-events",
        "format": "Unpacked",
        "skipControlSignals": true
      }
    
    # Publish critical stock events to the "critical-stock-events" topic
    critical-stock-event-query: >
      {
        "pubsubName": "notifications-pubsub",
        "topicName": "critical-stock-events",
        "format": "Unpacked",
        "skipControlSignals": true
      }
```

    How to Use Sources

## Introduction

Sources provide connectivity to the systems that Drasi can observe as sources of change. Sources are the inputs to Continuous Queries.

Sources perform three important functions within Drasi:
- Process the change log/feed generated by the source system and push those changes to each Continuous Query that uses that Source as input.
- Translate source data into a property graph data model so that subscribed Continuous Queries can use that data as if it where a graph of Nodes and Relations. For graph sources, such as Gremlin, no translation is necessary. But for non-graph sources, such as PostgreSQL and Kubernetes, the Source transforms the data (more detail is provided in the individual Sources sections below).
- Provide a way for Continuous Queries to query the source system to get the initial data required by the Continuous Query to bootstrap the query cache.

Drasi currently provides Source implementations for the following source systems:

- [Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin API](#azure-cosmos-db-gremlin-api-source)
- [PostgreSQL](#postgresql-source)
- [Kubernetes](#kubernetes-source) (experimental)

## Creation
Sources are custom Kubernetes resources that you can create and manage using `Kubectl`. 

The easiest way to create a Source, and the way you will often create one as part of a broader software solution, is to:

1. Collect credentials and endpoint addresses that provide access to the change log and query API of the source system.
1. Create a YAML file containing the Source Resource Definition. This will include the configuration settings that enable the Source to connect to the source system. This can be stored in your solution repo and versioned along with all the other solution code / resources.
1. Run Kubectl to apply the Source resource definition to the Kubernetes cluster where your Drasi environment is deployed.

As soon as the Source is created it will start running, monitoring its source system for changes and pushing them to subscribed Continuous Queries.

The Kubernetes resource definition for a Source has the following structure:

```
apiVersion: query.reactive-graph.io/v1
kind: Source
metadata:
  name: <source-id>
spec:
  sourceType: <source-type>
  properties: 
  - name: <property-name>
    value: <property-name>
  - ...
```
The following table provides a summary of these configuration settings:

|Name|Description|
|-|-|
|apiVersion|Must have the value **query.reactive-graph.io/v1**|
|kind|Must have the value **Source**|
|metadata.name|The **<source-id>** of the Source. Must be unique. Is used to manage the Source through Kubectl and in a Continuous Query definition to describe which Sources the Continuous Query uses as input.|
|spec.sourceType|The name of the type of Source to create. Must be one of **CosmosGremlin**, **PostgreSQL** or **Kubernetes**
|spec.properties|The configuration settings passed to the Source. Required settings differ depending on the Source implementation. See the individual Source sections below.|

If this Source resource definition was contained in a file called `source.yaml`, to create this query on a Drasi environment that was the current Kubectl context, you would run the command:

```
kubectl apply -f source.yaml
```

You can then use the standard Kubectl commands to query the existence and status of the Source resource. For example, to see a list of the active Sources, run the following command:

```
kubectl get sources
```


## Deletion
To delete an active Source, run the following command:

```
kubectl delete source <source-id>
```

For example, if the Source id is `human-resources`, you would run,

```
kubectl delete source human-resources
```

## Configuring Sources
The following sections describe the configuration of the Source types currently supported by Drasi.

### Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin API Source

The Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin API Source requires the following properties be set:

|Property|Description|
|-|-|
|sourceType| Must be the value 'CosmosGremlin' |
|SourceAccountEndpoint| |
|SourceConnectionString| |
|SourceDatabaseName| |
|SourceContainerName| |
|SourceContainerPartitionKey| |
|SourceKey| |

The following is an example of a fully configured Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin API Source using Kubernetes Secrets to securely store database credentials:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: comfy-creds
type: Opaque
stringData:
  SourceAccountEndpoint: AccountEndpoint=https://xx.xx:443/;AccountKey=xx;ApiKind=Gremlin;
  SourceKey: xxxxxx
---
apiVersion: query.reactive-graph.io/v1
kind: Source
metadata:
  name: facilities
spec:
  sourceType: CosmosGremlin
  properties: 
  - name: SourceAccountEndpoint
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: comfy-creds
        key: SourceAccountEndpoint
  - name: SourceConnectionString
    value: wss://xxxxxx.xxxxxx.xxxxxx:443/
  - name: SourceDatabaseName
    value: Contoso
  - name: SourceContainerName
    value: Facilities
  - name: SourceContainerPartitionKey
    value: name
  - name: SourceKey
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: comfy-creds
        key: SourceKey
```

### PostgreSQL Source

The PostgreSQL Source requires the following properties be set:

|Property|Description|
|-|-|
|sourceType| Must be the value 'PostgreSQL' |
|database.hostname| |
|database.port| |
|database.user| |
|database.password| |
|database.dbname| |
|tables| |

The following is an example of a fully configured PostgreSQL Source using Kubernetes Secrets to securely store database credentials:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: pg-creds
type: Opaque
stringData:
  password: xxxxxx
---
apiVersion: query.reactive-graph.io/v1
kind: Source
metadata:
  name: phys-ops
spec:
  sourceType: PostgreSQL
  properties: 
  - name: database.hostname
    value: reactive-graph.postgres.database.azure.com
  - name: database.port
    value: "5432"
  - name: database.user
    value: postgres@reactive-graph
  - name: database.password
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: pg-creds
        key: password
  - name: database.dbname
    value: phys-ops
  - name: tables
    value: public.Vehicle,public.Zone
```

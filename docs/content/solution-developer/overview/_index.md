    Reactive Graph for Solution Developers
---

**The Reactive Graph Preview is a prototype and is only suitable for experimentation.**

As a Developer who wants to create a solution that can observe and react to changes occuring in databases or other systems, using Reactive Graph might save you significant time and effort. To use Reactive Graph, you must do the following:

1. [Define a Source](/solution-developer/sources) for each of the source databases over which you want to run Continuous Queries.
1. [Define a Continuous Query](/solution-developer/continuous-queries) for each of the queries you want to run across those databases.
1. [Define Reactions](/solution-developer/reactions)  to handle the output from each of your Continuous Queries.

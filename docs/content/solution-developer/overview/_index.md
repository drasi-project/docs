    Drasi for Solution Developers
---

**The Drasi Preview is a prototype and is only suitable for experimentation, not for production systems.**

To use Drasi you must do the following three things:

1. Define [Sources](/solution-developer/sources) for each of the source systems over which you want to run Continuous Queries.
1. Define [Continuous Queries](/solution-developer/continuous-queries) for each of the queries you want to run across those sources.
1. Define [Reactions](/solution-developer/reactions)  to handle the output from each of your Continuous Queries.

The Drasi repo includes multiple [Sample Applications](/solution-developer/sample-apps/) that are fully functional solutions that use Drasi to varying degrees.

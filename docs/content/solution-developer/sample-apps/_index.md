The [apps](https://dev.azure.com/azure-octo/Incubations/_git/ReactiveGraph?version=GBdevelop&path=/apps) folder in the Drasi source repo contains a number of example applications that demonstrate the full range of capabilities provided by Drasi. The following links provide documentation about how those applications are designed and how they use Drasi.

Details about the installation of these applications can be found in the [Installing Sample Applications](/administrator/sample-app-deployment) section of the [Administrator Guides](/administrator).

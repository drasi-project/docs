{{< term "Source" "Sources" >}} connect Drasi to your existing databases and software systems, enabling Drasi to observe changes as they occur. Drasi works with your existing systems--you don't need to build new systems to use Drasi.

Sources perform three important functions:

- **Process changes**: Monitor the change log or feed generated by the source system and push those changes to each {{< term "Continuous Query" >}} that uses that Source as input.
- **Translate data**: Convert source data into a consistent {{< term "Property Graph" "property graph" >}} data model so Continuous Queries can work with it as {{< term "Node" "Nodes" >}} and {{< term "Relationship" "Relations" >}}. For graph sources like Gremlin, no translation is needed. For relational sources like PostgreSQL, the Source transforms records into graph nodes.
- **Initialize state**: Provide a way for Continuous Queries to query the source system at startup to {{< term "Bootstrap" "bootstrap" >}} the initial query result.

## How Sources Work

When you create a Source, you provide the connection details and credentials needed to access the source system. When started, the Source:

1. Connects to the source system's change feed or log
2. Subscribes to changes for the data types your Continuous Queries need
3. Translates incoming changes into the {{< term "Source Change Event" >}} format used internally by Drasi
4. Pushes changes to subscribed Continuous Queries in real-time

Sources handle the complexity of different database protocols and {{< term "Change Data Capture" "change data capture" >}} mechanisms, presenting a unified stream of Source Change Events to your Continuous Queries.

## Available Source Implementations

Different Source implementations are available depending on which Drasi product you use:

| Source Type | {{< term "drasi-lib" >}} / {{< term "Drasi Server" >}} | {{< term "Drasi for Kubernetes" >}} |
|-------------|:------------------------:|:--------------------:|
| PostgreSQL | Yes | Yes |
| MySQL | - | Yes |
| Microsoft SQL Server | - | Yes |
| Azure Cosmos DB (Gremlin API) | - | Yes |
| Azure Event Hubs | - | Yes |
| Microsoft Dataverse | - | Yes |
| Kubernetes | - | Yes |
| HTTP | Yes | - |
| gRPC | Yes | - |
| Mock | Yes | - |
| Platform (Redis Streams) | Yes | - |

## Source Lifecycle

Sources are long-running components that:

- Start monitoring for changes as soon as they are started
- Continue running until explicitly stopped or deleted
- Automatically reconnect if the connection to the source system is interrupted
- Push changes to all Continuous Queries that subscribe to them

{{< alert title="Dependency Impact" color="warning" >}}
When a Source is deleted, any Continuous Queries that depend on it will stop receiving changes.

Drasi for Kubernetes does not currently enforce dependency integrity between Sources and Continuous Queries, so plan your Source lifecycle carefully.

## Configuring Sources

Source creation and configuration varies by Drasi product. Each product provides its own approach for defining Sources with connection details, credentials, and provider-specific settings.

To configure Sources for your deployment, see the product-specific guides:

- **[Drasi Server Sources](/drasi-server/how-to-guides/configuration/configure-sources/)** - Configure Sources in standalone server deployments
- **[Drasi for Kubernetes Sources](/drasi-kubernetes/how-to-guides/configure-sources/)** - Configure Sources using Kubernetes resource manifests

For **drasi-lib**, Sources are configured programmatically via the Rust API. See the [drasi-lib documentation](/drasi-lib/) for details.

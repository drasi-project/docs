The [apps](https://dev.azure.com/azure-octo/Incubations/_git/ReactiveGraph?version=GBdevelop&path=/apps) folder in the Drasi source repo contains a number of example applications that demonstrate the full range of capabilities provided by Drasi. The following links provide documentation about how to deploy those application to a self-hosted Drasi environment.

Details about the design of these applications can be found in the [Sample Applications](/solution-developer/sample-apps) section of the [Solution Developer Guides](/solution-developer).

# Getting Started
The best way to start is to read the [Overview](/overview) to understand the problem Reactive Graph solves and learn the purpose and capabilities of the three main platform components: **Sources**, **Continuous Queries**, and **Reactions**.

The next step depends on what you want to do...

- If you are interested in **discussing** Reactive Graph, having a **demonstration**, or getting access to a live demo environment so you can **explore** solutions built using Reactive Graph, email [Allen Jones (alljones)](mailto:alljones@microsoft.com).

- If you are a **developer** that wants to **use** Reactive Graph in a solution you are creating, go to the [Solution Developer Guides](/solution-developer).

- If you are a **developer** that wants to **contribute** to Reactive Graph or **create custom extensions** for Reactive Graph, go to the [Platform Developer Guides](/platform-developer).

- If you want to **deploy** a Reactive Graph environment of your own or **manage** an existing environment, go to the [Administrator Guides](/administrator)

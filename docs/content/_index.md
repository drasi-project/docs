    Making it easier to observe and react to change in dyanamic systems
---

# The Problem
Itâ€™s too hard to build solutions that observe and react to changes in complex dynamic systems, and its even harder to build solutions that make it easy for consumers to observe and react to change.

While there are established patterns and technologies that help developers deal with each of these challenges, the knowledge, skills, and time taken to implement them effectively at scale are beyond the capabilities of many people and organizations. 

# The Solution
We believe we can do better with a solution that blends the best in monitoring continuously changing data with the best in simplified application development.

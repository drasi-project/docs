    Mission: Make it easier to detect and react to change in dynamic systems
---

Drasi is a **Data Change Processing** platform that makes it easier to build dynamic solutions that detect and react to change in data from multiple source systems. Drasi is built around three simple components: **Sources**, **Continuous Queries**, and **Reactions**.

A single Drasi environment can host many Sources, Continuous Queries, and Reactions, composing them together to build scalable Data Change Processing capabilities to power dynamic business solutions. 

## Sources
Sources provide connectivity to the systems that Drasi can observe as sources of change. These are often relational or graph databases in which the system of interest stores its data. But Sources can be implemented for any system that provides a low-level change feed and a way to query the current state of the system. 

 ![Sources Component](sources-component.png)

Drasiâ€™s Source input schema is modeled on Debezium (https://debezium.io), an open-source Change Data Capture platform that has adapters for many common data sources. By embracing the open data standard defined by Debezium, Drasi will be able to use many existing Debezium sources as input. 

## Continuous Queries
Continuous Queries, as the name implies, are queries that run continuously. To understand what is unique about them, it is useful to contrast them with a the kind of **instantaneous queries** people are accustomed to running against databases or search engines. 

When you issue an instantaneous query, you are running the query against the database at a point in time. The database calculates the results to the query and returns them. While you work with those results, you are working with a static snapshot of the data and are unaware of any changes that may have happened to the data after you ran the query.

![Instantaneous Query](instantaneous-query.png)

If you run the same instantaneous query periodically, if changes have been made to the database, the query results might be different each time. If you use instantaneous queries periodically to detect change, you must compare the most recent and previous query results to determine what has changed. This can be complex, inefficient, and imprecise.

Continuous Queries, once started, continue to run until they are stopped. While running, Continuous Queries maintain a perpetually accurate query result, incorporating any changes made to the source database as they occur. Not only do Continuous Queries allow you to request the current query result at any point in time, but as changes occur, the Continuous Query determines exactly which result elements have been added, updated, and deleted, and distributes the precise changes description to all Reactions that have subscribed to the Continuous Query.

 ![Continuous Query](continuous-query.png)

 Continuous Queries are implemented as graph queries written in [Cypher Query Language](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/). The use of a declarative graph query language means you can easily express rich query logic that takes into consideration both the properties of the data you are querying and the relationships between data. Continuous Queries also enable you to create queries that span data across multiple Sources, even when there is no natural connection between data in the Source systems. Multiple Continuous Queries can use the same Source.

## Reactions
Reactions receive a stream of query result changes generated by one or more Continuous Queries and take action. Drasi provides standard Reactions that:
- forward the query result updates to Azure Event Grid or SignalR so they can be processed by solution specific code in applications, services, and functions.
- use the query result updates as input to configurable Stored Procedures and Gremlin commands to update databases without the need to integrate with additional intermediary software services.

## Benefits
Drasi provides significant benefits over existing change event/notification approaches, including:
- Continuous Queries are written as declarative graph queries using the Cypher Query Language, making them easy to write, while supporting a rich and expressive syntax. Using a single query, you describe the changes you want to detect, and the data you want to capture to describe when those changes occur.
- Continuous Queries are graph queries, allowing you to write queries that walk relationships that exist between connected data elements or which aggregate data across a set of connected elements. 
- Continuous Queries can incorporate data from multiple sources, even if the data from those sources has no natural connection and uses different data schema. For example, data both a Gremlin database and a PostgreSQL database could be used in a single query.
- Out of the box support for multiple source systems including Azure Cosmos Gremlin API, PostgreSQL, and Kubernetes. 
- Integration with the rich Change Data Capture ecosystem provided by the open source Debezium project.
- Out of the box Reactions include support for the following:
  - forwarding changes to Azure Event Grid so you can integrate easily with PowerPlatform functionality as well as bespoke applications, services, and functions.
  - forwarding changes to SignalR so you can integrate easily with Web Applications and use real-time output from Continuous Queries to drive application UIs.
  - use the changes to automatically execute commands and stored procedures on source databases
- The ability to write custom Reactions that process the output of Continuous Queries means you can easily customize the change handling functionality provided by Drasi.

## Getting Started
The next step depends on what you want to do...

- If you are interested in **discussing** Drasi, having a **demonstration**, or getting access to a live demo environment so you can **explore** solutions built using Drasi, email [Allen Jones (alljones)](mailto:alljones@microsoft.com).

- If you are a **developer** that wants to **use** Drasi to add Continuous Queries to a solution you are creating, go to the [Solution Developer Guides](/solution-developer).

- If you are a **developer** that wants to **contribute** to Drasi or **create custom Reactions** for Drasi, go to the [Platform Developer Guides](/platform-developer).

- If you want to **deploy** or **manage** a Drasi environment, go to the [Administrator Guides](/administrator)

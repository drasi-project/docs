You need a database and data to experiment with Drasi. Ideally you will be able to use an existing database that contains data that you are familiar with and which is relevant to you; this will make it much easier to appreciate the value of Drasi.

However, if you do not have a database and/or data available, the following sections contain instructions on how to setup various databases and datasets that the Core Drasi Team regularly use for development and testing, or which are used in the published Drasi demo apps. These datasets can be used as {{< term "Source" "Sources" >}} for your {{< term "Continuous Query" "Continuous Queries" >}}.

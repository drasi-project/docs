project:
  name: Drasi
  one_liner: "Drasi is an open-source Data Change Processing platform that makes it easier to build change-driven solutions."
  website: https://drasi.io
  repo: https://github.com/drasi-project/drasi-platform
  license: Apache 2.0
  current_stable_version: early-release
  development_stage: CNCF Sandbox

mission:
  purpose: |
    Drasi enables change-driven architectures—a specialized subset of event-driven architecture—by providing declarative 
    continuous queries to monitor data sources, isolate semantic changes, and trigger precise reactions, eliminating the 
    overhead of parsing, filtering, and state management in generic event streams.
  problem_it_solves: 
    Traditional event-driven systems rely on producer-defined events requiring heavy consumer-side logic for change isolation; 
    polling wastes resources and lacks real-time precision; Drasi codifies change semantics for efficient, scalable reactivity 
    to both presence and absence of change."
  non_goals:
    - "Generic event streaming or arbitrary payload processing (e.g., like Kafka)"
    - "Static, one-time queries (Drasi focuses on perpetual, change-aware monitoring)"
    - "Change Data Capture (CDC) for data replication"

audience:
  primary: |
    Solution architects, software developers, and DevOps engineers building reactive, change-driven systems in cloud-native, IoT, 
    or enterprise environments.
  secondary: "Open-source contributors, CNCF members, and teams at organizations like Microsoft."

competitors_and_positioning:
  - name: Apache Kafka / Azure Event Hubs
    similarity: medium
    differences:
      - "Drasi isolates semantic changes via declarative continuous queries, not raw event firehoses; built-in change semantics over consumer parsing."
      - "Handles absence of change with future functions vs. external timers."
  - name: Polling-based solutions (e.g., cron jobs)
    similarity: low
    differences:
      - "Proactive, real-time change notifications without resource waste or delays; temporal semantics for sustained states."
  - name: Custom CDC processors (e.g., Debezium)
    similarity: high
    differences:
      - "Graph-aware queries (openCypher/GQL) for relationship changes; integrated reactions and priority queue for efficiency."
      - "CNCF Sandbox project with multi-language query support."
  - name: Event-driven frameworks (e.g., LangGraph)
    similarity: low
    differences:
      - "Precise diffs and temporal handling vs. workflow orchestration; consumer-defined semantics over producer events."

key_phrases:
  always_say:
    - "Drasi is an open-source Data Change Processing platform in CNCF Sandbox for change-driven architectures."
    - "Continuous queries maintain a real-time view, notifying reactions of precise additions, updates, deletions."
    - "Supports openCypher and ISO-standard GQL for declarative graph pattern matching."
    - "Change semantics defined by the query author, not the source system."
  never_say:
    - "Event-driven wrapper"  # Drasi specializes in semantic changes, not generic events
    - "Like Kafka but declarative"  # Focus on paradigms and patterns
    - "Polling alternative"  # It's perpetual and proactive with temporal semantics

core_concepts:
  - term: Change
    definition: "A set of additions, updates, and/or deletions to a continuous query result set occurring because of changes to the source data; has precise semantics defined by the author of the query, not the source system."
    aliases: [delta, transition]
    forbidden_terms: [event, signal]
  - term: Continuous Query
    definition: "A query that runs perpetually, fed by change logs from one or more data sources, maintaining the current set of query results and generating change notifications when those results change due to data modifications."
    aliases: [cq, perpetual query]
    forbidden_terms: [static query, poll]
  - term: Reaction
    definition: "A triggered notification or action emitted in response to a precise change (add/update/delete) in a continuous query's result set, enabling clear state transitions like entering or exiting conditions."
    aliases: [handler, action]
    forbidden_terms: [listener, subscriber]
  - term: Source
    definition: "Data repository (e.g., databases, Kubernetes, monitoring tools) that feeds change logs into continuous queries for real-time processing."
    aliases: [connector, feed]
    forbidden_terms: [stream, topic]
  - term: Change-Driven Architecture
    definition: "A specialized subset of event-driven architecture focused on isolating and responding to specific, consumer-defined data changes rather than raw events."
    aliases: [CDA]
    forbidden_terms: [generic event-driven]
  - term: Change Semantics
    definition: "Clearly defined meaning of data changes (e.g., additions, updates, deletions) in the context of a continuous query, reducing dependency on source system assumptions."
    aliases: [semantic change]
    forbidden_terms: [event payload]

terminology: 
  Absence of Change: "The challenge of responding to sustained states or lack of data updates, e.g., a condition persisting without explicit events; handled via future functions."

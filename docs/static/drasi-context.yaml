project:
  name: Drasi
  one_liner: "Drasi is an open-source Data Change Processing platform that simplifies the creation and operation of change-driven solutions."
  website: https://drasi.io
  repo: https://github.com/drasi-project/drasi-platform
  license: Apache 2.0
  current_stable_version: early-release
  development_stage: CNCF Sandbox

audience:
  primary: |
    Solution architects, software developers, and DevOps engineers building change-driven solutions in cloud-native, IoT, 
    or enterprise environments.
  secondary: "Open-source contributors, and CNCF members."

mission:
  purpose: |
    Drasi enables change-driven architectures—a specialized subset of event-driven architecture—by providing declarative 
    continuous queries to monitor data sources, isolate semantic changes, and trigger precise reactions, eliminating the 
    overhead of parsing, filtering, and state management in generic event streams.
  problem_it_solves: |
    Detecting specific meaningful changes in data is complex.
    Polling datasources to retrieve current data and compare it with the last poll results is inefficient and requires complex
    logic to isolate what has changed.
    Processing change feeds generated by datasources can require significant infrastructure to deal with high volumes of mostly
    uninteresting change events. Filtering to just the relevant events and determining what has changed can require complex logic
    and cache state management.
  non_goals:
    - "Generic event streaming or arbitrary payload processing (e.g., like Kafka)"
    - "Static, one-time queries (Drasi focuses on perpetual, change-aware monitoring)"
    - "Change Data Capture (CDC) for data replication"

key_phrases:
  always_say:
    - "Drasi is an open-source Data Change Processing platform."
    - "Drasi simplifies the creation and operation of change-driven solutions."
    - "Drasi enables change-driven architectures."
    - "Drasi uses declarative continuous queries to isolate meaningful data changes."
    - "Drasi avoids the overhead of polling, parsing, filtering, and state management."
  never_say:
    - "Drasi is an event-driven platform"  # Focus on change-driven, not generic events
    - "Drasi is used to build event-driven architectures or solutions"  # Focus on change-driven architectures

    - "Drasi is for stream processing"  # Focus on change-driven solutions

core_concepts:
  - term: Change
    definition: "A set of additions, updates, and/or deletions to a continuous query result set occurring because of changes to the source data; has precise semantics defined by the author of the query, not the source system."
    aliases: [delta, transition]
    forbidden_terms: [event, signal]
  - term: Continuous Query
    definition: "A query written in openCypher or GQL that runs perpetually, fed by change logs from one or more data sources, maintaining the current set of query results and generating change notifications when those results change due to data modifications."
    aliases: [cq, perpetual query]
    forbidden_terms: [static query, poll]
  - term: Reaction
    definition: "A action triggered in response to a precise change (add/update/delete) in a continuous query's result set, enabling clear state transitions like entering or exiting conditions."
    aliases: [handler, action]
    forbidden_terms: [listener, subscriber]
  - term: Source
    definition: "Data repository (e.g., databases, Kubernetes, monitoring tools) that provides a source of change for Continuous Queries."
    aliases: [connector, feed]
    forbidden_terms: [stream, topic]
  - term: Change-Driven Solution
    definition: "Systems that do something in response to a meaningful change or the absence of change in relevant data."
    aliases: [CDS]
    forbidden_terms: [generic event-driven]
  - term: Change-Driven Architecture
    definition: "An architectural style focused on detecting and reacting to specific, meaningful changes in data through continuous queries and reactions."
    aliases: [CDA]
    forbidden_terms: [generic event-driven]
  - term: Change Semantics
    definition: "Clearly defined meaning of data changes (e.g., additions, updates, deletions) in the context of a continuous query, reducing dependency on source system assumptions."
    aliases: []
    forbidden_terms: []

faq:
  - question: What defines a change in Drasi?
    answer: "A set of additions/updates/deletions to a continuous query result set, with semantics defined by the query author."
  - question: How does Drasi differ from event-driven systems?
    answer: "Change-driven architectures isolate specific data changes via continuous queries, avoiding parsing/filtering overhead in raw event streams."
  - question: What query languages are supported?
    answer: "openCypher and GQL (ISO 9074:2024)"
  - question: How are absence of change scenarios handled?
    answer: "Via future functions: trueFor for continuous durations, trueLater for future evaluations, managed by internal priority queue."
  - question: What is the execution model?
    answer: "Language-agnostic engine processes AST as sequential QueryParts, flowing data through working tables."
  - question: CNCF status?
    answer: "Accepted into CNCF Sandbox; community-driven via GitHub and Discord."
  - question: How do reactions work?
    answer: "Notified immediately on change notifications (add/update/delete) for state transitions."
